## Update on 04-07
I had big trouble figuring out why images are not stored properly in the data frame in a generator.
Instead of being blocked, why don't we just read everytime

Need better error raising so I don't need to be stuck at call stacks.
And I realized the error eas becuase an additional ` ` before `IMG/dxx.jpg`
